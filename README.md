#### CLASSIFICATION-ON-IRIS-DATASET

In this project I have worked with IRIS dataset and have tried to explore libraries like Numpy,Pandas,Scikit,Matplotlib pyplots etc. and different classifiers available.

###### The different types of classifiers considered here are: <br>
-- KNN Classifier<br>
-- Linear SVM Classifier<br>
-- Decision Tree based Classifier<br>
-- Gradient Boosting Classifier<br>

Performance Comparision between these classifiers and tuning there hyperparameters are explored.
